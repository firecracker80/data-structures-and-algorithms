## Challenge
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
The challenge was to create three classes(Node, BT, and BST). BT class required the depth first traversal methods (preorder, inorder, and postorder) and the BST class is a subclass of the BT class, and requires the the add and contains methods. The BT class will return an array of appropriately ordered values, while the BST will add a new node with value, and

The BT class will return an array of appropriately ordered values, while the BST will add a new node with value, and use the contains method to check for value, return true if present, false if not.git stat

Today's challenge is to find the max value in the binary tree, using preOrder traversal and findMaxValue methods.

findMaxValue - public void, designed to find the max value a the binary tree.

BST public methods:
add - this method will add a new node with value
contains - this method will return a boolean of true, if the node contains a value.
