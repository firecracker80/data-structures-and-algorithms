# Singly Linked List
This a code challenge that requied that a linked list be created, and then populated with elements. Once these elements were added to the empty linked list, check to verify that the elements are contained within in.

## Challenge
The challenge is create the empty list, added elements, verify the elements are contained within, and finally return a string with the contained elements.

## Approach & Efficiency
I decided to research first to get an understanding and potentially find the solution to the challenge. Once the solution was found, I used it as a reference, and modified a few areas to the challenge. I have yet to figure out the toString method and testing, yet it successfully compiled without errors.
## API
No APIs were used for this challenge.
