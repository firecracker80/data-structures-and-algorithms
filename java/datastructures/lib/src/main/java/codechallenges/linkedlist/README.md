## Approach & Efficiency

I decided to research first to get an understanding and potentially find the solution to the challenge. Once the solution was found, I used it as a reference, and modified a few areas to the challenge. I have yet to figure out the toString method and testing, yet it successfully compiled without errors.

I wrote the code for the includes and toString method. There is an error, but I am not seeing where since I can't seem to compile it to run the debugger. I tried to write a test to test if the LinkedList equals a value, but it failed. I reached out for help, but it's Labor Day weekend, not much luck.
