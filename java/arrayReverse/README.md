## Approach & Efficiency
I decided to use Invision to create my whiteboard. It is a free online app I am comfortable using.

I began by outlineing the problem domain first, so that I would have a clear picture of how I was going to break it down. I then was able to quickly elaborate the algorithm, visualization and step through. The most time consuming part was writing the code, and testing it to ensure it would work.

I did enlist the help of my classmates to review my code, since I had a five week hiatus.
